Space Explorer

This program is a 2-D side-scrolling game created using Python. The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible by dodging the oncoming planets. The controls for this game include the arrow keys, where each arrow key corresponds with the direction the player wants to move. The game also includes a life system where the player has three lives, and the player loses lives if the player comes in contact with a zombie. However, the player can regain a life if they come in contact with the heart that goes across the screen randomly.
